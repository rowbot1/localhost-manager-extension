# Privacy Policy for LocalHost Manager

**Last Updated: January 2025**

## Overview
LocalHost Manager is a browser extension that detects and manages services running on localhost ports. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Data Collection
LocalHost Manager does **NOT** collect, store, or transmit any personal data. The extension:

- **Does NOT** collect user information
- **Does NOT** track browsing history
- **Does NOT** send data to external servers
- **Does NOT** use analytics or tracking services
- **Does NOT** require user accounts or authentication

## Local Storage
The extension stores minimal data locally on your device using Chrome's storage API:
- User preferences (auto-scan enabled, notifications enabled)
- Custom service names you assign to ports
- View preferences (grid/list view)
- Last scan results

This data is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted elsewhere.

## Permissions Used
The extension requires the following permissions:
- **storage**: To save your preferences locally
- **alarms**: To schedule periodic port scans
- **notifications**: To notify you when new services are detected (if enabled)
- **host_permissions** (localhost only): To detect services running on localhost

## Network Access
The extension only accesses localhost (127.0.0.1) to detect running services. It does not make any external network requests.

## Data Sharing
We do not share any data with third parties because we do not collect any data.

## Children's Privacy
This extension does not collect any information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy
If we change this privacy policy, we will update the "Last Updated" date and notify users through the extension update notes.
