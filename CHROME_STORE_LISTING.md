## Single Purpose Description
This extension detects and provides quick access to services running on localhost ports, helping developers manage their local development environment.

## Why are you requesting these permissions?

**storage**: To save user preferences (like custom service names and view settings) locally on the device.

**alarms**: To schedule periodic scans for new services without impacting browser performance.

**notifications**: To optionally notify users when new services are detected (can be disabled in settings).

**host_permissions (localhost only)**: To detect which services are running on localhost ports. The extension only accesses localhost/127.0.0.1 and never makes external network requests.
