## Pro Tips ðŸŽ¯

1. **Clean Desktop:** Hide desktop icons and use a clean wallpaper

4. **Multiple Takes:** Record 3-4 times and pick the best
5. **Edit Out Mistakes:** Most tools let you trim frames

## Alternative: Video Demo

If GIF is too limiting, create a short MP4:
1. Record at 1080p
2. Keep it under 60 seconds
3. Add captions for key features
4. No audio needed (autoplay friendly)
5. Convert to GIF later if needed
